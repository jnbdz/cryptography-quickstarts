## Comes with Kali crypto stego tools
- [**aesfix**](https://www.kali.org/tools/aesfix/) [Homepage](https://citp.princeton.edu/our-work/memory/code/) - This program illustrates a technique for correcting bit errors in an AES key schedule. It should be used with the output of the aeskeyfind program. It is limited to AES-128 key schedules, and it can only correct unidirectional 1->0 bit errors. For the most part it has been optimized for readability rather than performance. This package is useful to several activities, as forensics investigations.
- [**aesfind**](https://www.kali.org/tools/aeskeyfind/) [Homepage](https://citp.princeton.edu/our-work/memory/code/) - This program illustrates automatic techniques for locating 128-bit and 256-bit AES keys in a captured memory image. The program uses various algorithms and also performs a simple entropy test to filter out blocks that are not keys. It counts the number of repeated bytes and skips blocks that have too many repeats. This method works even if several bits of the key schedule have been corrupted due to memory decay. This package is useful to several activities, as forensics investigations.
- [**ccrypt**](https://www.kali.org/tools/ccrypt/) [Homepage](http://ccrypt.sourceforge.net/) - ccrypt is a utility for encrypting and decrypting files and streams. It was designed as a replacement for the standard unix crypt utility, which is notorious for using a very weak encryption algorithm. ccrypt is based on the Rijndael cipher, which is the U.S. governmentâ€™s chosen candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES, see http://www.nist.gov/aes). This cipher is believed to provide very strong security.
- [**outguess**](https://www.kali.org/tools/outguess/) [Homepage](https://github.com/resurrecting-open-source-projects/outguess) - OutGuess is a universal tool for steganography that allows the insertion of hidden information into the redundant bits of data sources. The nature of the data source is irrelevant to the core of OutGuess. The program relies on data specific handlers that will extract redundant bits and write them back after modification. The supported formats are JPEG, PPM and PNM. This package is useful in forensics investigations and security actions.
- [**steghide**](https://www.kali.org/tools/steghide/) [Homepage](http://steghide.sourceforge.net/) - Steghide is steganography program which hides bits of a data file in some of the least significant bits of another file in such a way that the existence of the data file is not visible and cannot be proven. Steghide is designed to be portable and configurable and features hiding data in bmp, jpeg, wav and au files, blowfish encryption, MD5 hashing of passphrases to blowfish keys, and pseudo-random distribution of hidden bits in the container data. Steghide is useful in digital forensics investigations.
- [**stegsnow**](https://www.kali.org/tools/stegsnow/) [Homepage](http://www.darkside.com.au/snow) - This utility can conceal messages in ASCII text by appending whitespaces to the end of lines. Because spaces and tabs are generally not visible in text viewers, the message is effectively hidden from casual observers. And if the built-in encryption is used, the message cannot be read even if it is detected. About the name: locating trailing whitespace in text is like finding a polar bear in a snowstorm. And it uses the ICE encryption algorithm, so the name is thematically consistent. This package is useful for personal security, forensics investigations and other actions.
